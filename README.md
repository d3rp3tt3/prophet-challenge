# UNC-Chapel Hill Bootcamp: Prophet Predictions
> Module 8 project challenge

## Objectives
* Evaluate search and stock trends for Mercado Libre
* Calculate stock returns hour-over-hour
* Plot data for search trends and stock trends
* Determine whether there's any relationship between stock trends and search trends
* Predict search trends with Prophet
* Model and plot search trends hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
* Derive and describe insights on all of the above

## What's In This Project
The objectives are all met within one Jupyter Notebook: [forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb](forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb).

This Notebook file includes both Python code cells and inline Markdown cells that conduct analysis.

## Running the Project
Because this project uses Prophet heavily, I recommend you upload the Jupyter Notebook file to Google Collab. You can do this easily by clicking the Open in Collab button in the Notebook file.

Prophet is a machine-learning library that requires a lot of computational power. With Google Collab, you can run the Notebook in Google's Cloud without having to install anything on your local computer.
